-- QUERIES
-- Question 1 : What are the most common finish methods and how many fights ended by each method?
SELECT method, 
	   COUNT(*) AS count
FROM fights
GROUP BY method
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Question 2 : What is the distribution of fighters by weight class?
SELECT COALESCE(weight_class, 'Unknown') AS weight_class,
       COUNT(*) AS n_fighters
FROM fighters
GROUP BY COALESCE(weight_class, 'Unknown')
ORDER BY n_fighters DESC;

-- Question 3 : Who are the top fighters by win_ratio?
SELECT id, 
	   name, 
	   experience,
	   win_ratio
FROM fighters
WHERE COALESCE(experience,0) >= 5
ORDER BY win_ratio DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Question 4 : What are the number of fights per year?
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM e.date)::INT AS year,
       COUNT(*) AS num_fights
FROM fights f
JOIN events e ON f.event_id = e.event_id
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;


-- Question 5 : What are the total counts of each finishing method and what percentage are they of the total?
SELECT COALESCE(method,'Unknown') AS method,
       COUNT(*) AS cnt,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fights), 2) AS pct_of_all_fights
FROM fights
GROUP BY COALESCE(method,'Unknown')
ORDER BY cnt DESC;

-- Question 6 : Define the win ratios by weight class.
SELECT weight_class,
	   COUNT(*) AS n_fighters,
	   ROUND(AVG(win_ratio)::numeric, 3) AS avg_win_ratio
FROM fighters
GROUP BY weight_class
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
ORDER BY avg_win_ratio DESC;


-- Question 7 : How many fights happened each year, and whatâ€™s the 3-year moving average?
WITH per_year AS (
  SELECT DATE_TRUNC('year', e.date)::date AS year,
         COUNT(*) AS num_fights
  FROM fights f
  JOIN events e ON f.event_id = e.event_id
  GROUP BY year
)
SELECT year,
       num_fights,
       ROUND(AVG(num_fights) OVER (ORDER BY year ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)::numeric,2) AS ma_3yr
FROM per_year
ORDER BY year;


-- Question 8 : Which are the top active fighters per year?
WITH participants AS (
  SELECT f.fight_id, e.date, f.r_id AS fighter_id FROM fights f JOIN events e USING(event_id)
  UNION ALL
  SELECT f.fight_id, e.date, f.b_id AS fighter_id FROM fights f JOIN events e USING(event_id)
),

         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY fights_count DESC) AS rn

	   r.fighter_id, 
	   pl.name, 
	   r.fights_count
